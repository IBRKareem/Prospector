# Prospector
Gibson's Prospector Solitaire

NOTE: THIS WAS DONE WITH A LAPTOP WITH UNITY ALREADY INSTALLED. I FORGOT TO CHECK FOR THE PROPER VERSION
NOTE: I DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GITHUB DESKTOP ON THE LAPTOP DUE TO PRESSED TIME I WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PROJECT AND I KNOW WHERE THE GRADE WILL FALL BASED ON THE SYLLABUS

NOTE: I CREATED MY OWN PREFABS...SCRIPTS...ETC. FOLDERS, THAT MIGHT END UP CLASHING WITH THE ONES YOU PROVIDED.
